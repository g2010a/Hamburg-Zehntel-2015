                The Hamburg what?
            </h3>
            <p>Das Hamburg Zehntel is a 4km run in Hamburg, Germany for children in elementary school 
               (Zehntel means one-tenth, which refers to the length being one tenth of a full marathon).

            <h3>Fewer girls than boys</h3>
            <div id="age_histogram"></div>
            <div>
                <p>A peek at the age histogram reveals that there were <strong>more boys than girls in almost all age categories</strong>,
                but the discrepancy is more pronounced in the 4th grade (ages 10-11).<br/> 
                In Germany, this is the age when children graduate from elementary school; could this be 
                an indication of increased pressure placed on boys to become more competitive?<br/> 
                Also noteworthy is that second graders were equally split this year.
                </p>
                <p>The same trend holds for the previous two years as well:</p>  
            </div>
            <div style="max-width: 600px">
                <img src="images/age_histograms.png" alt="Age histograms 2013-2015"></img>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Boys run faster, have more competition</h3>
            <div>
                <div class="img_container">
                    <div id="runtime_histogram">
                        <img src="images/runtime_histograms.png" alt="Run time histograms 2013-2015"></img>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>The run time histograms show that boys were generally faster than girls &ndash; the higher number of
                    older boys undoubtedly plays a role.
                    </p>
                    <p>The distribution of runnning times among girls follows a symmetrical normal curve centered around
                    29 minutes (8.3 km/h or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=8.3km%2Fh">a fourth of the speed of a falling raindrop</a>).
                    The same distribution for boys, however, is skewed towards faster times, evidencing the aforementioned
                    increased competitiveness (peaking at 24 minutes, or 10 km/h). Of the top 10 finalists, only one was a girl (7th place)
                    and with the exception of one boy, all were 10 years or older.
                    </p>
                    <p>In short, the proportion of fast boys was greater than the proportion of fast girls, and boys 
                        ran the Zehntel three minutes faster than girls. 
                    </p>

            <p>Data for this analysis was scraped from the <a href="http://hamburg-zehntel.r.mikatiming.de/2015/">Das Zehntel 2015 results page</a>. Additional columns were added as follows</p>

                        <td>Overall ranking</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>Country</td>
                        <td>A substring of <code>Name</code>. That it represents a country is an assumption as nowhere is the meaning of the substring elucidated in the original table</td>
                    </tr>
